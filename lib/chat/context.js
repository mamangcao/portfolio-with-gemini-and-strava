--- BEYOND CODING (Interests) ---
When I am not coding, I dedicate time to continuously enhancing my skills and exploring new technologies. I balance this by staying active:
- At the same time, I keep my energy levels high by mixing high-intensity workouts and running, or taking long walks to reflect and recharge, which give me the space to clear my head and stay focused.
